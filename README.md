# Unsupervised Learning for Automated Plastic Identification in Salami Slices using FD-FLIM
This project addresses the challenge of detecting microplastic contamination in food using Frequency-Domain Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FD-FLIM) and an unsupervised learning approach. A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model was developed to differentiate microplastics from food particles based on fluorescence data without requiring labeled datasets, improving scalability and cost-efficiency.
