# Anomaly Detection Using VAE(GMM)
Microplastics are small plastic fragments that pose health risks. Detecting microplastics in food products, such as salami, is crucial for ensuring food safety and quality.
This project uses Variational Autoencoder Gaussian Mixture (VAE GMM)model to automate the detection process.
